# GPProgress
Shows the evolution of the f1 and motogp rankings in pure javascript.
You can add the points after each gp, manually, in the page source in the 'tabella' element.
e.g .:  1 | VERSTAPPEN Max | 0 | 25 | 0 | 34 | 26 | 25 | 15 | * 1 *
becomes 1 | VERSTAPPEN Max | 0 | 25 | 0 | 34 | 26 | 25 | 15 | 25 | * 1 *

You can reimplement these html files to view the progression of any sport ranking.
